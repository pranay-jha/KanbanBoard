1. What was the hardest part about this project? Which part of building your app gave you the most difficulty?

The hardest part about this project was learning how to use Swing to create the GUI and making it easy to use and somewhat presentable. I had some experience using it before in high school to create simple country flags, but there was a bit of a learning curve to add user input and to make a proper layout. I learned to use the various classes of Swing, such as JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JTextField, GridBagLayout and GridBagConstraints among others in order to accomplish this.

Another difficult part was learning how to edit and delete elements in the SQLite database that I used to save the sticky notes and their positions after the GUI window was closed, which involved becoming more familiar with SQLite and JDBC. My solutions in the end were somewhat hacky, but seem to serve their purpose at the moment, but I could foresee some issues if one were to scale up this project.

2. Where did you get your inspiration for the app?

As a full-time college student, achieving a proper study-life balance is very important to me and to many of my peers. I had used Scrum/Agile project management frameworks in the past when working on large projects in robotics, and realized I could use a simplified version for tasks in my life, such as homework and chores. This is why I opted to make a Kanban board for my final project, which I could use as a to-do list and as a progress tracker.

3. Go back and look at your project proposal. (For those that gave me several, I'm talking about the proposal for the app you eventually built.) How close to this proposal do you feel you ended up getting? For those parts that you didn't do, why? (Remember that I never intended for you be able to complete the whole thing.) 

My original project proposal was more of an all-in-one productivity app, including schedules, calendars, and to-do lists, but as I started working on the project I realized how daunting completing all aspects of my original proposal would be, considering I was already struggling to make a simple to-do list GUI. And I knew later I would have to work with the SQLite databases to make it a bit more cohesive, which would be another challenge to get up and running. So, in the end I decided to focus on the to-do list aspect of the original, and later modified it to be a Kanban board, which required a bit more enhanced GUI.

4. What would you need to explore or learn in order to finish this app? Is that something you can see yourself doing in the future?

In the future, I would like to learn about different database handling methods so that I can use more than just strings and integers with SQLite, as it was a bit limiting for my project. I have had some experience using MongoDB, a NoSQL database program along with JSONs when I was making a website in high school and as far as I can remember it had a lot more flexibility. I could definitely see myself doing so in the future as I am interested in productivity applications and want to make a web-based one that has the ability to save and transform user data. I would also need to pick up some more advanced front-end development skills as well.
